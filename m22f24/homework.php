<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>
In Math 13 you have a number of responsibilities, the first of which is being fully aware 
of the content of the <a href="general_info.php">general information</a> page.
</p>

<p>
In particular, that page contains:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/wp/m13sample1/general-information/#exams">dates of midterm exams,</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/wp/m13sample1/general-information/#hw">policy regarding homework</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/wp/m13sample1/general-information/#honor">how the honor principle applies</a> in this course, and</li>
    <li><a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/wp/m13sample1/general-information/#grades">how grades will be computed</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are web-based homework assignments which are due before each class period, 
as well as written assignments which are due once a week. Further details are provided 
both by the above links (but you have looked at those already) as well as below.
</p>

<h3>Web-based homework assignments</h3>

<p>
The daily web-based problems can be accessed via the 
<a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu">WeBWorK Login</a> link on the navigation bar at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
It is highly recommended that you keep a notebook in which you write up 
your WeBWorK homework (including your work as well as the answers). Then when you are studying for exams, you will have a record of your work two which to refer.
</p>

<h3>Written homework assignments</h3>

<p>
The weekly written homework assignments will be posted here.
</p>

<ul>

<li>Written homework should be turned in to the homework boxes outside of Kemeny XXX by 11:15am on the due date.
More details will follow ******.</li>

<li>Make sure that you show all your work and explain all the steps.
A correct answer with no work shown will receive minimal credit.
This is good practice for what will be expected on exams.</li>

<li>Make sure your homework is neatly written; if the graders cannot read it, you will receive zero credit.
We also have some technical requirements: Use standard-sized paper that does not have ragged edges from being torn out of a spiral notebook.</li>

</ul>
